## Introduction
## Theoretical background
## Case study concept description

The proposed demonstration of using OpenTelemetry will consist of using a set of these tools in the EmotoAGH project's web application. The mentioned application is responsible for:

- Collecting measurements from motorcycles created in the project,
- Aggregating, sorting, filtering measurements,
- Securing access based on the RBAC concept,
- A sufficiently universal API used by the website and another team of mobile applications.


It is publicly available, and its availability options are based on the user roles declared.
The application is available on bare-metal Kubernetes on Oracle OCI machines. We plan to use the mentioned project to observe its behaviors, events, logs, metrics and potential errors by deploying appropriate OpenTelemetry tools.
